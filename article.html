    <h1>Drake's Charmed Life: The Tough Times And Succeses Of Aubrey Graham</h1>
    <h3>By: Hive Media</h3>
  </div>
  <p class="contentText ">If you thought that Drake was the only successful rapper in the buisness, you’d be sadly mistaken. Music was a big part of Drake’s upbringing with his father Dennis Graham working as a drummer for rock and roll superstar Jerry Lee Lewis. Also, his uncle played the bass guitar for Sly and the Family Stone and Prince.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p class="contentText">Even on his mother’s side, there was a lot of musical influence on Drake as a boy. Music even brought his parents together, and the two met after Dennis performed at the Clue Bluenote where he first interacted with his mother, Sandra.</p>

  <h2 class="contentHeading">The True Indentity of Drake</h2>
  <p class="contentText">Most people know him as “Jimmy” from Degrassi or “Drake” from his music career. However, he was born Aubrey Drake Graham on October 24, 1986, Ontario, Canada. In order to still keep part of his given name for his music career, he decided to use his middle name for his musical identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  His father is an African American from Memphis, Tennessee and his mother is a Jewish Canadian. As a boy, he attended a Jewish day school and even had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony. He also holds dual citizenship to both the United States and Canada.</p>

  <h2 class="contentHeading">High School Was A Tough Time For Drake</h2>
  <p class="contentText">After his parents divorced when he was five, he was raised by his mother in Toronto, Canada. His mother instilled Jewish traditions in Drake as a young boy, which later proved to make things difficult for Drake growing up. While in high school, Drake was the minority attending an all-white school. Not only was Drake African American, but he was also Jewish which truly set him apart from his peers.
  <br>
  <br>
  During that time, he felt isolated explaining that “nobody understood what it was like to be black and Jewish.” Luckily, for Drake, he saw this as an opportunity to grow himself into a stronger person and rely on himself rather than the opinions of others.</p>

  <h2 class="contentHeading">Degrassi: The Next Generation</h2>
  <p class="contentText">Eager to become an actor, when he was just 15, a friend introduced Drake to his father, who happened to be an acting agent. The two worked together, and Drake landed a role on the Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. He played the character of basketball star Jimmy Brooks who eventually lost the use of his legs after being the victim of a school shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  While acting on Degrassi, he was essentially supporting he and his mother who was very sick at the time. He acted on the show from 2001 until 2007, appearing in 145 episodes</p>
